# ABPRS
Hi :D Here's a preliminary R package for ABPRS. Please let me know if you have any questions!

# Instructions on How to Load R Package:
Since it is currently a private package, you will need to download it first before installing. 

To install in R library, use:
devtools::install("filepath")
To load, use:
library(ABPRS)

If you do not wish to install in the R library and solely load the package, use:
devtools::load_all("filepath")

# Tasks:
- Come up with better names
- See which functions to keep/combine
- Refine descriptions
