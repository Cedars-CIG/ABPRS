# ABPRS
Hi :D Here's a preliminary R package for ABPRS. Please let me know if you have any questions!

# Instructions on How to Load R Package:
Since it is currently a private package, you will need to download it first before installing. 

METHOD 1:
1. To install in R library, use:
     ```ruby
     devtools::install("filepath")
     ```
2. To load, use:
     ```ruby
     library(ABPRS)
     ```

METHOD 2:

If you do not wish to install in the R library and solely wish to load the package, use:

```ruby
devtools::load_all("filepath")
```

# Tasks:
- Come up with better names
- See which functions to keep/combine
- Refine descriptions
